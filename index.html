            <p><strong>Over the past decade, we at <a href="https://theengineroom.org" target="_blank">The Engine Room</a> have grown confident that resilient civil societies have huge potential to make the world a better place. They can disrupt unfair power dynamics and protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities. They can achieve a fairer distribution of resources, privileges and opportunities.</strong></p>
            <p>But as we go into 2020, the social sector faces ever-larger threats. Nonprofits operate in competitive environments with limited resources and are under continued attack around the world. They often fall prey to unhealthy work cultures and struggle with burnout and misconduct. In recent years we have also witnessed how technology has become part of the problem itself by reinforcing injustices and wasting limited resources, while facilitating new avenues for systematic abuses of power. Trust in the idea that technology can support the fight for social justice has eroded greatly. </p>
            <p>This year we set our minds on two big goals. First, to help civil society embrace the complexity of working with technology. Second, to contribute to building a resilient civil society through promoting healthy work cultures. And while we’re only at the beginning of our journey, we’ve made some great progress this year.</p>
            <p>This year, we worked with over 100 partners to help them identify the opportunities–and avoid the pitfalls–presented by technology. We started unpacking complex concepts and ideas like the what it takes for nonprofits to reuse existing tech solutions and what the lived experience of digital identification systems actually is. We explored the complexity of consent in the digital age and the impact of data protection regulations. We began working with six new partners as part of our Matchbox programme, which offers intensive support.</p>
            <p>To practice what we preach on resiliency, we designed policies that prioritise our staff’s wellbeing as a political act and embarked on an experiment to shorten our workweek. We introduced new avenues of cross-team collaboration to ensure that the complexity of the problems we face is addressed through diverse perspectives. </p>
            <p>We were honored to share our year of learning, growing and supporting with a diverse group of partners, allies and friends, and look forward to what this year brings!</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br/><strong>Julia</strong></p>

            <h2>About the 2019 Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 2019, we have worked to align our internal team structure more closely with the ways in which we work in practice. In defining new teams, we aim to facilitate even better collaboration and provide a more robust support to all of our partners. Each of our four new teams works closely with the other three–these aren’t meant to be silos but instead a helpful structure to encourage serendipity.</p>
            <p>Our four new teams are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Support</strong>, which provides targeted local support</li>
              <li><strong>Research</strong>, to conduct thoughtful and context-aware research</li>
              <li><strong>Engagement</strong>, which connects with folks to learn from them and share our knowledge</li>
              <li><strong>Technology</strong>, to ground us in our commitment to responsibly and effectively weaving technology throughout our work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The stories of our work below illustrate some of the work these teams led and collaborated on this year. You’ll notice that some stories appear under more than one team–that’s by design!</p>

              <p>Infrastructure–the often unseen structures that shape the systems sitting on top of them–is often only noticed when it breaks or when something goes wrong. Investing in and prioritising infrastructure (before it breaks) can have huge benefits and can drastically change, for the better, how an organisation works. We thought about this as we discussed the community infrastructure required to keep the responsible data community healthy and as we designed participatory research structures to centre the voices of our researchers and their communities. This year we began to work more on digital infrastructure, too. As disillusionment in Big Tech came to a head, it was clear that many groups want to take back control of their own infrastructure in a sustainable way (or at the very least, make more informed choices about how they use tech). After all, our technical choices are political ones, too.</p>

              <p>In the face of attacks on the work of justice-seeking civil society, building our own resilience and a strong institution is more important than ever. We’ve experimented with different ways of doing that this year, knowing that our own support work is stronger if we ourselves feel supported and trusted. We’ve tested out a four-day workweek, a change inspired by increasing evidence that shorter workweeks increase performance, commitment, motivation and work-life balance –all of which resonate greatly with our values. We’ve also developed a Team Handbook with our core policies and a Programmes Handbook to make the most of the diverse ways we do our work. We were also thrilled to receive a BUILD grant from the Ford Foundation to help us continue to strengthen our own institution over the next five years. Self-care is not a one-off checklist exercise, but an ongoing process that is critical to doing our work well and taking care of each other.</p>
