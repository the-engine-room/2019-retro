            <p><strong>Over the past decade, we at <a href="https://theengineroom.org" target="_blank">The Engine Room</a> have grown confident that resilient civil societies have huge potential to make the world a better place. They can disrupt unfair power dynamics and protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities. They can achieve a fairer distribution of resources, privileges and opportunities.</strong></p>
            <p>But as we go into 2020, the social sector faces ever-larger threats. Nonprofits operate in competitive environments with limited resources and are under continued attack around the world. They often fall prey to unhealthy work cultures and struggle with burnout and misconduct. In recent years we have also witnessed how technology has become part of the problem itself by reinforcing injustices and wasting limited resources, while facilitating new avenues for systematic abuses of power. Trust in the idea that technology can support the fight for social justice has eroded greatly. </p>
            <p>This year we set our minds on two big goals. First, to help civil society embrace the complexity of working with technology. Second, to contribute to building a resilient civil society through promoting healthy work cultures. And while we’re only at the beginning of our journey, we’ve made some great progress this year.</p>
            <p>This year, we worked with over 100 partners to help them identify the opportunities–and avoid the pitfalls–presented by technology. We started unpacking complex concepts and ideas like the what it takes for nonprofits to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-digital-tool-re-use-looks-like-among-uk-charities/" target="_blank">reuse existing tech solutions</a> and what the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-are-the-stages-of-creating-a-digital-id-system/" target="_blank">lived experience of digital identification systems</a> actually is. We explored the complexity of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/unpacking-informed-consent/" target="_blank">consent in the digital age</a> and the impact of <a href="https://responsibledata.io/stories/dataprotection-reflection/" target="_blank">data protection regulations</a>. We began working with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/welcoming-our-2019-matchbox-family/" target="_blank">six new partners as part of our Matchbox programme</a>, which offers intensive support.</p>
            <p>To practice what we preach on resiliency, we designed <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">policies that prioritise our staff’s wellbeing</a> as a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-a-healthy-remote-org/" target="_blank">political act</a> and embarked on an experiment to shorten our workweek. We introduced <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">new avenues of cross-team collaboration</a> to ensure that the complexity of the problems we face is addressed through diverse perspectives. </p>
            <p>We were honored to share our year of learning, growing and supporting with a diverse group of partners, allies and friends, and look forward to what this year brings!</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br/><strong>Julia</strong></p>

            <h2>About the 2019 Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 2019, we have worked to align our internal team structure more closely with the ways in which we work in practice. In defining new teams, we aim to facilitate even better collaboration and provide a more robust support to all of our partners. Each of our four new teams works closely with the other three – <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">these aren’t meant to be silos but instead a helpful structure to encourage serendipity</a>.</p>
            <p>Our four new teams are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Support</strong>, which provides targeted local support</li>
              <li><strong>Research</strong>, to conduct thoughtful and context-aware research</li>
              <li><strong>Engagement</strong>, which connects with folks to learn from them and share our knowledge</li>
              <li><strong>Technology</strong>, to ground us in our commitment to responsibly and effectively weaving technology throughout our work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The stories of our work below illustrate some of the work these teams led and collaborated on this year. You’ll notice that some stories appear under more than one team–that’s by design!</p>

              <span class="story-icon support">Direct Support</span>
              <p>In a world where over <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/democratic-governance/legal-empowerment/reports-of-the-commission-on-legal-empowerment-of-the-poor/making-the-law-work-for-everyone---vol-ii---english-only/making_the_law_work_II.pdf" target="_blank">4 billion people live outside the protection of the law</a>, legal empowerment work is increasingly needed. In 2018, we partnered with the Open Society Justice Initiative to analyse the work of 136 legal empowerment initiatives worldwide.</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/tech-and-legal-empowerment-around-the-world/" target="_blank">Our research</a> found that there were many opportunities for increased learning and sharing, which prompted us to offer <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/seeking-support-in-using-tech-for-legal-empowerment/" target="_blank">pro-bono, actionable and tailored support</a> to legal empowerment organisations interested in working more with data and tech. Using what we’d learned through our research, we supported thirteen partners working on legal empowerment issues in different countries. We also experimented with new (to us) ways of providing support, like teaming up with <a href="https://community.namati.org/" target="_blank">Namati’s</a> team explore a new way of being in touch with their community via an <a href="https://community.namati.org/t/ask-me-anything-about-the-engine-room-s-light-touch-support-16-august-2019/69727" target="_blank">‘Ask Me Anything Session’</a>. We’re excited to continue learning about technology in legal empowerment as we support the <a href="http://www.laic.org.za/" target="_blank">Legal Advisory Information Center</a> (LAIC) in South Africa as part of our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/welcoming-our-2019-matchbox-family/" target="_blank">intensive support programme</a>.</p>

              <h2>How to re-use existing digital tools</h2>
              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>
              <p>We believe in supporting civil society to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/responsible-waste-management-in-civic-tech/" target="_blank">reduce digital waste</a>, which could involve re-using existing solutions instead of building new tools from scratch. In 2019 we sought to understand what conditions and contexts favour the successful <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-refine-it/" target="_blank">repurposing of existing technologies</a> and explored the topic of re-use in two different areas.</p>

              <p>Through the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/investigating-digital-tool-re-use-among-uk-charities/" target="_blank">Digital Sparks</a> project, we researched how <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/are-you-re-using-digital-tools/" target="_blank">UK charities</a> re-use existing digital tools for service delivery. We investigated how organisations choose tools, the conditions that make re-use possible and the value (and limitations) of re-use. <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-digital-tool-re-use-looks-like-among-uk-charities/" target="_blank">We found that</a> while re-use isn’t necessarily always the best option, in many cases it can enable quick testing, make it easier for organisations to kickstart their entry into designing digital services, increase a team’s confidence and positively impact attitudes towards digital tools more broadly.</p>

              <p>We also carried out research into tool re-use within open contracting initiatives, supported by the <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/" target="_blank">Open Contracting Partnership</a> (OCP) and the World Bank. With this research we asked:: What conditions increase the likelihood of success for an organisation looking to re-use an existing open contracting tool? Certain factors came up as significant contributors to success, including in-person support (from tool authors or support providers), training, clear and thorough tool documentation, and the simplicity and adaptability of tools themselves.</p>

              <h2>Understanding the lived reality of digital identification systems</h2>
              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>

              <p>When it comes to digital systems, we believe it’s just as important to understand the contextual realities as it is to dig into the technical functionalities. In a year-long research project (our largest research project to-date!), we investigated the lived experiences of people in five regions where <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-id-why-it-matters/" target="_blank">digital identification systems</a> are being implemented: national systems in Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Thailand, and humanitarian systems in refugee camps in Bangladesh and Ethiopia. We worked with in-country researchers in each location and co-developed participatory <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-id-where-were-headed/" target="_blank">research methods</a> that would respect contextual differences and explore related themes. Across geographies, we found that though digital ID systems provide important benefits, such as access to services, they also consistently raise challenges, particularly for with respect to the communities whose rights are already being denied that we spoke with. Some of these challenges included low levels of public and civil society involvement, barriers to use, lack of informed consent and concerns about data protection. </p>
              <p>We hope that our findings can help our researchers, local advocates and other researchers push for more context-respecting digital ID systems around the world. To enable this, our findings can be accessed in a thematic report, and advocacy toolkit and five country case studies, all available in English, Spanish, French and Arabic. In-keeping with our commitment to context-respecting work, the country case studies are all available in the respective local languages of the site they cover – all in all, that totalings to 12 different languages. In 2020, we’ll be looking to use what we learned to support civil society in advocating for digital ID systems that meet their needs; if that sounds like you, get in touch.</p>

              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>
              <span class="story-icon engagement">Engagement</span>
              <p><a href="https://responsibledata.io" target="_blank">The Responsible Data (RD) community</a> celebrated its 5th birthday in 2019. With over a thousand members, the RD community–through a website, mailing list, newsletter and community events–is a space for reflection and debate about practical ways to both avoid unintended negative consequences when using data for social justice work and develop better, rights-respecting ways of using data. 2019 was a year of many fruitful discussions on issues such as <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/unpacking-informed-consent/" target="_blank">informed consent</a>, the use of call detail records in the humanitarian sector, biometrics in aid delivery and more. </p>
              <p>The power of the RD community shone when, earlier in 2019, a partnership was announced between the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/exploitative-data-practices-never-match-mission/" target="_blank">World Food Program (WFP) and Palantir Technologies</a>, a private tech company with ties to the CIA. The RD community engaged in dialogue that resulted in an <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2019/02/08/open-letter-to-wfp-re-palantir-agreement/" target="_blank">open letter to WFP</a>. This letter was representative of a <a href="https://digitalimpact.io/4q4-zara-rahman-the-problem-with-palantir-ep-01/" target="_blank">larger debate</a> around how to ensure that civil society work is free from exploitative data practices and that institutions like WFP commit to using rights-respecting technical systems and partnerships. </p>
              <p>To continue to <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2019/10/08/building-for-online-offline-communities/" target="_blank">foster an enjoyable and safe environment</a> for all members, this year we collaboratively built <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cx2nO86gJBmg40TZdJLcT8e8hD3i3svUPb5gbMG1WQg" target="_blank">community guidelines and a policy for the RD listserv</a>. Together with <a href="http://merltech.org/" target="_blank">MERL Tech</a>, we also published a living collection of Responsible Data-related <a href="https://responsibledata.io/2019/03/28/responsible-data-resource-list/" target="_blank">resources</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/matchbox-program/" target="_blank">Through our Matchbox partnerships</a>, we work alongside organisations as they implement projects. We provide context-specific, holistic support on how to effectively and responsibly harness data and tech. This year we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/welcoming-our-2019-matchbox-family/" target="_blank">welcomed six new Matchbox partners</a> from five different countries. </p>
              <h3>Latin America </h3>
              <p>One of our partners in Latin America is the <a href="https://www.cels.org.ar/web/en/" target="_blank">Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS)</a>, an Argentinian organisation known for its work documenting human rights violations. We are working with CELS to improve the databases they have created to document cases and to help them draw out advocacy targets from their data. Also in Argentina is the <a href="https://acij.org.ar/" target="_blank">Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y Justicia (ACIJ)</a>, a civil society organisation promoting access to information, transparency and government accountability. We have been collaborating with ACIJ to update their Budget Monitor platform, designed to flag government budget reallocations, which can indicate misspent funds or corruption. In Paraguay, we’ are working with <a href="https://www.reaccion.org.py/" target="_blank">reAcción</a>, an organisation conducting citizen-led monitoring of the country’s public education fund. </p>
              <h3>Sub-Saharan Africa </h3>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.laic.org.za/" target="_blank">Legal Advisory Information Center (LAIC)</a> is an organisation seeking to make land tenure and rights more inclusive, just and equitable through their legal empowerment work. With them, we are exploring how data and technology can amplify access to justice to unserved communities in South Africa. We have also been working with the <a href="http://kcspog.org/" target="_blank">Kenya Civil Society Platform for Oil and Gas</a> – a coalition that advocates for transparency and accountability in the Kenya’s oil and gas sector–supporting them to develop a system that aggregates otherwise siloed datasets on oil and gas contracts. We also teamed up with the <a href="http://procurementmonitor.org/ppdc/" target="_blank">Private Public Development Center (PPDC) in Nigeria</a>, who work with open contracting tools to improve procurement governance.  We’ve been supporting them to increase the usefulness and uptake of their open data portals.</p>

              <h2>Exploring the positive impact of data protection legislation</h2>
              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>
              <span class="story-icon engagement">Engagement</span>
              <p>The implementation of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 raised many debates on how civil society could be affected by this new data protection legislation. Civil societiesy working outside the digital rights space worried that data protection legislation might even hinder their activities – but as ever, the reality is blurrier than that. This year, we sought to bring a constructive lens to these debates, exploring <a href="https://responsibledata.io/stories/dataprotection-reflection/" target="_blank">how the GDPR had been – and could be – used to <em>strengthen</em> the work of civil society</a>. With the support of the <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/" target="_blank">Open Society Foundations</a>, we gathered examples of how data protection legislations can lead to impactful and innovative work: from strengthening the fight for <a href="https://responsibledata.io/rd-reflection-stories/data-rights-for-workers-in-the-gig-economy/" target="_blank">worker’s rights</a> to advancing privacy rights and addressing <a href="https://responsibledata.io/rd-reflection-stories/addressing-stalkerware-and-gender-based-abuse-through-data-protection-law/" target="_blank">tech-enabled, gender-based abuse</a>. We shared more about this work on <a href="https://digitalimpact.io/when-choosing-digital-tools-consider-context/" target="_blank">this Digital Impact podcast episode</a>, too. We hope these case studies can serve as inspiration to other organisations wondering how to make data protection legislation into an opportunity rather than a burden.</p>

              <p>For our partner <a href="https://youngfeministfund.org/" target="_blank">FRIDA</a>, 2019 was a year dedicated to identifying opportunities where they could use data and technology more intentionally and in-line with their values. As an organisation that supports women, girls and trans* youth all over the world, FRIDA wanted to ensure that the way they choose and implement technology matches their political views. To support them in doing this, we worked with FRIDA’s team to identify steps they could take, processes they could implement and goals they could define – taking stock of what they have already, what they want to get to, and collaboratively developing a roadmap of how they can get there. Keep an eye on <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/blog/" target="_blank">our blog</a> for tactics and tools you can use to do the same in your organisation.</p>

              <h2>Balancing transparency and privacy in beneficial ownership </h2>
              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>
              <p>In different parts of the world, governments and institutions are taking action against the abuse of anonymous company ownership by requiring more transparency around who actually owns private companies. (The individuals who own some kinds of companies are sometimes called “beneficial owners” and are afforded a great deal of anonymity in many jurisdictions.) By making this kind of information transparent, it’s easier to track illicit flows of information and, potentially, corruption. While increasing transparency is generally a positive move, in the case of beneficial ownership registers <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/beneficial-ownership-transparency-and-data-protection/" target="_blank">questions about data protection and privacy</a> have been raised. Supported by <a href="https://www.openownership.org/" target="_blank">OpenOwnership</a> and <a href="http://www.bteam.org/" target="_blank">The B Team</a>, The Engine Room learned that public disclosure of information about beneficial ownership is a reasonable measure to increase transparency, but governments should be mindful of privacy when implementing it. </p>

              <p>In Chile–as in many areas of the world–the end of 2019 was marked by protests and calls for social change. What started as a series of protests against an increase in public transport fees in Santiago has grown into a broader movement denouncing increasing levels of inequality, expensive healthcare, low levels of education funding, and violence against women and LGBTQI people. Across Throughout the country, diverse groups are uniting coming together to call for a more just future, demanding reforms to the constitution, which is a relic from Chile’s pre-democratic past under military leader Augusto Pinochet. The government has responded with force and violence–in the first weeks of the protests there were over <a href="https://www.indh.cl/indh-rm-recibe-la-historica-cifra-de-mas-de-2300-vulneraciones-de-ddhh-en-20-dias/" target="_blank">2,300 accusations of human rights violations</a>. Within this context, we provided security support to feminist groups, citizen journalists, gender activists, artist collectives and others. We supported some organisations to set up more secure communications channels through VPNs and secure messaging. Together with journalists, we explored ways to keep mobile devices more secure. We also offered guidance around ways to plan ahead for internet shutdowns and what could be done if and when they happen. As the protests continue...</p>

              <p>Alongside our ongoing work in providing <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/light-touch-support/" target="_blank">light touch support</a> to activists and civil society organisations that reach out to us, in 2019 we proactively identified spaces where our knowledge could be particularly relevant. This led us to support over thirteen organisations working on legal empowerment, such as the pro-bono arm for the legal practice DLA piper.</p>
              <p>We also supported Sekondi Takorandi Municipality in Ghana in improving their municipal budget transparency. By creating more user friendly visualisations of their budgets, they were able to share information with local communities. With <a href="https://www.haqdarshak.com/" target="_blank">Haqdarshak</a>, an organisation based in India that uses a platform to help citizens benefit from welfare schemes, we worked to improve user design and experience, while also considering taking responsible data practices into consideration. We also supported <a href="https://www.trocaire.org/" target="_blank">Trocaire</a>, a non-profit that fights against human rights abuses and gender-based violence in 17 countries, in improving their processes of data collection and case management software.</p>

              <p>Infrastructure–the often unseen structures that shape the systems sitting on top of them–is often only noticed when it breaks or when something goes wrong. Investing in and prioritising infrastructure (before it breaks) can have huge benefits and can drastically change, for the better, how an organisation works. We thought about this as we discussed the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/co-creating-community-guidelines-with-the-responsible-data-community/" target="_blank">community infrastructure required to keep the responsible data</a> community healthy and as we <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/digital-id-where-were-headed/" target="_blank">designed participatory research structures</a> to centre the voices of our researchers and their communities. This year we began to work more on digital infrastructure, too. As disillusionment in Big Tech came to a head, it was clear that many groups want to take back control of their own infrastructure in a sustainable way (or at the very least, make more informed choices about how they use tech). After all, our technical choices are political ones, too.</p>

              <p>In the face of attacks on the work of justice-seeking civil society, building our own resilience and a strong institution is more important than ever. We’ve experimented with different ways of doing that this year, knowing that our own support work is stronger if we ourselves feel supported and trusted. We’ve tested out a four-day workweek, a change inspired by increasing evidence that shorter workweeks increase performance, commitment, motivation and work-life balance –all of which resonate greatly with our values. We’ve also developed a Team Handbook with our core policies and a Programmes Handbook to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">make the most of the diverse ways we do our work</a>. We were also thrilled to receive a <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/building-institutions-and-networks/" target="_blank">BUILD grant from the Ford Foundation</a> to help us continue to strengthen our own institution over the next five years. Self-care is not a one-off checklist exercise, but an ongoing process that is critical to doing our work well and taking care of each other.</p>

          <h1>Personal Accomplishments</h1>
          <p>Outside of The Engine Room, our team members had a year filled with personal accomplishments. Some of us experienced the joys and challenges of parenting, like attending school events, sports competitions, and balancing our work while also taking care of loved ones. Some of us welcomed new additions to our families, with recent marriages and the births of nieces and nephews. Some moved to new places, others travelled to beautiful places (like the Balkans and Patagonia). Some of us tried new things this year, like attending a writer's residency for the first time. Many of us made great connections throughout the year and we got to meet incredible people (like Chimamanda Adichie!).</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>Much of our work in the past decade focused on civil society's general awareness around tech and data. Now that technology is no longer seen as a luxury but rather a necessity, we want to direct our energies to shape civil society’s collective thinking around tech’s role and impact. As we go into the new year and embark on a team-wide process to refresh our strategy, we're looking to do more of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a vision for tech and data that matches with the political choices of those working in social justice </li>
              <li>Help civil society distinguish between meaningful and over-hyped tech solutions.</li>
              <li>Strengthen  our partners' digital infrastructure so that they have control over their operations</li>
              <li>Co-create tactics for resource conservation in our partner's work with tech and data.</li>
              <li>Design new ways to support civil society's advocacy efforts around emerging technologies.</li>
              <li>Build bridges between groups whose work has been previously siloed, to enable us all to align and collaboratively address complex tech and social justice issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Does this sound interesting or useful? We’d love to hear from you!
