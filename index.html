            <p><strong>Over the past decade, we at <a href="https://theengineroom.org" target="_blank">The Engine Room</a> have grown confident that resilient civil societies have huge potential to make the world a better place. They can disrupt unfair power dynamics and protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable communities. They can achieve a fairer distribution of resources, privileges and opportunities.</strong></p>
            <p>But as we go into 2020, the social sector faces ever-larger threats. Nonprofits operate in competitive environments with limited resources and are under continued attack around the world. They often fall prey to unhealthy work cultures and struggle with burnout and misconduct. In recent years we have also witnessed how technology has become part of the problem itself by reinforcing injustices and wasting limited resources, while facilitating new avenues for systematic abuses of power. Trust in the idea that technology can support the fight for social justice has eroded greatly. </p>
            <p>This year we set our minds on two big goals. First, to help civil society embrace the complexity of working with technology. Second, to contribute to building a resilient civil society through promoting healthy work cultures. And while we’re only at the beginning of our journey, we’ve made some great progress this year.</p>
            <p>This year, we worked with over 100 partners to help them identify the opportunities–and avoid the pitfalls–presented by technology. We started unpacking complex concepts and ideas like the what it takes for nonprofits to <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-digital-tool-re-use-looks-like-among-uk-charities/" target="_blank">reuse existing tech solutions</a> and what the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/what-are-the-stages-of-creating-a-digital-id-system/" target="_blank">lived experience of digital identification systems</a> actually is. We explored the complexity of <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/unpacking-informed-consent/" target="_blank">consent in the digital age</a> and the impact of <a href="https://responsibledata.io/stories/dataprotection-reflection/" target="_blank">data protection regulations</a>. We began working with <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/welcoming-our-2019-matchbox-family/" target="_blank">six new partners as part of our Matchbox programme</a>, which offers intensive support.</p>
            <p>To practice what we preach on resiliency, we designed <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">policies that prioritise our staff’s wellbeing</a> as a <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/building-a-healthy-remote-org/" target="_blank">political act</a> and embarked on an experiment to shorten our workweek. We introduced <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">new avenues of cross-team collaboration</a> to ensure that the complexity of the problems we face is addressed through diverse perspectives. </p>
            <p>We were honored to share our year of learning, growing and supporting with a diverse group of partners, allies and friends, and look forward to what this year brings!</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br/><strong>Julia</strong></p>

            <h2>About the 2019 Retrospective</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 2019, we have worked to align our internal team structure more closely with the ways in which we work in practice. In defining new teams, we aim to facilitate even better collaboration and provide a more robust support to all of our partners. Each of our four new teams works closely with the other three – <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/making-the-most-of-a-remote-and-diverse-team/" target="_blank">these aren’t meant to be silos but instead a helpful structure to encourage serendipity</a>.</p>
            <p>Our four new teams are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Support</strong>, which provides targeted local support</li>
              <li><strong>Research</strong>, to conduct thoughtful and context-aware research</li>
              <li><strong>Engagement</strong>, which connects with folks to learn from them and share our knowledge</li>
              <li><strong>Technology</strong>, to ground us in our commitment to responsibly and effectively weaving technology throughout our work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The stories of our work below illustrate some of the work these teams led and collaborated on this year. You’ll notice that some stories appear under more than one team–that’s by design!</p>

              <p>In a world where over 4 billion people live outside the protection of the law, legal empowerment work is increasingly needed. In 2018, we partnered with the Open Society Justice Initiative to analyse the work of 136 legal empowerment initiatives worldwide.</p>
              <p>Our research found that there were many opportunities for increased learning and sharing, which prompted us to offer pro-bono, actionable and tailored support to legal empowerment organisations interested in working more with data and tech. Using what we’d learned through our research, we supported thirteen partners working on legal empowerment issues in different countries. We also experimented with new (to us) ways of providing support, like teaming up with Namati’s team explore a new way of being in touch with their community via an ‘Ask Me Anything Session’. We’re excited to continue learning about technology in legal empowerment as we support the Legal Advisory Information Center (LAIC) in South Africa as part of our intensive support programme.</p>

              <h2>How to re-use existing digital tools</h2>
              <span class="story-icon research">Research</span>
              <p>We believe in supporting civil society to reduce digital waste, which could involve re-using existing solutions instead of building new tools from scratch. In 2019 we sought to understand what conditions and contexts favour the successful repurposing of existing technologies and explored the topic of re-use in two different areas.</p>

              <p>Through the Digital Sparks project, we researched how UK charities re-use existing digital tools for service delivery. We investigated how organisations choose tools, the conditions that make re-use possible and the value (and limitations) of re-use. We found that while re-use isn’t necessarily always the best option, in many cases it can enable quick testing, make it easier for organisations to kickstart their entry into designing digital services, increase a team’s confidence and positively impact attitudes towards digital tools more broadly.</p>

              <p>We also carried out research into tool re-use within open contracting initiatives, supported by the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP) and the World Bank. With this research we asked:: What conditions increase the likelihood of success for an organisation looking to re-use an existing open contracting tool? Certain factors came up as significant contributors to success, including in-person support (from tool authors or support providers), training, clear and thorough tool documentation, and the simplicity and adaptability of tools themselves.</p>

              <p>Infrastructure–the often unseen structures that shape the systems sitting on top of them–is often only noticed when it breaks or when something goes wrong. Investing in and prioritising infrastructure (before it breaks) can have huge benefits and can drastically change, for the better, how an organisation works. We thought about this as we discussed the community infrastructure required to keep the responsible data community healthy and as we designed participatory research structures to centre the voices of our researchers and their communities. This year we began to work more on digital infrastructure, too. As disillusionment in Big Tech came to a head, it was clear that many groups want to take back control of their own infrastructure in a sustainable way (or at the very least, make more informed choices about how they use tech). After all, our technical choices are political ones, too.</p>

              <p>In the face of attacks on the work of justice-seeking civil society, building our own resilience and a strong institution is more important than ever. We’ve experimented with different ways of doing that this year, knowing that our own support work is stronger if we ourselves feel supported and trusted. We’ve tested out a four-day workweek, a change inspired by increasing evidence that shorter workweeks increase performance, commitment, motivation and work-life balance –all of which resonate greatly with our values. We’ve also developed a Team Handbook with our core policies and a Programmes Handbook to make the most of the diverse ways we do our work. We were also thrilled to receive a BUILD grant from the Ford Foundation to help us continue to strengthen our own institution over the next five years. Self-care is not a one-off checklist exercise, but an ongoing process that is critical to doing our work well and taking care of each other.</p>
